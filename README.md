# Text-classification-using-RNN
 Overview
Welcome to the world of cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP)! In this repository, we dive deep into the fascinating realm of text classification using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Whether you’re a seasoned NLP enthusiast or a curious coder, this project promises to ignite your neurons (pun intended)!

What’s Inside?
Data Preprocessing Magic Wand: We’ll clean, tokenize, and vectorize our text data like true sorcerers. Say goodbye to messy sentences and hello to tidy word embeddings!
The RNN Cauldron: Our secret potion? A carefully brewed RNN architecture. We’ll explore vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs. Expect some serious incantations involving hidden states and time steps.
Spellbinding Training: We’ll train our RNNs on enchanting datasets—sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization. Watch as our models learn to distinguish between love letters and hate mail!
Validation Spells: Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and validation curves—our arsenal against overfitting. Because even wizards need to validate their magic spells.
Predictions from the Crystal Ball: Deployed models will predict whether that email is a Nigerian prince’s plea for help or just plain spam. Spoiler alert: It’s usually spam.
Magical Visualization: We’ll visualize attention weights, hidden states, and perplexity scores. Prepare to be mesmerized by colorful gradients and perplexing plots.
